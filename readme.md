# Visual Search Experiment:

This repo is dedicated to the development of a visual search task under the "Addidional Singleton" paradigm. Is created using [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/) and the [jspsych-psychophysics](https://jspsychophysics.hes.kyushu-u.ac.jp/) plugin. 

At the moment, I copy/paste the task I have already created in (this repository)[https://github.com/franfrutos/Additional_Singleton_jsPsych]. I have to change the manipulation (statistical regularities in singleton spatial position vs instrumental learning related to the singleton color) and set up the rest of the task. 

### TODO:

- [ ] Create instructions.
- [ ] Create Practice trials.
- [ ] Create main task.
